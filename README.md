Pouncingiguana's 3dprinting repositry
=====================================
Here you can find my collection of printing profiles, cad bits and
pieces, test prints, and more. I'll be adding things as I've gotten them
into shape. I take no repsonsibility if any of the
stuff here causes your printer to gain sentience, steal your car, and
head for warmer pastures.

Cura Profiles
-------------
Right now these are build for delta printers (specifically the ones from
SeeMeCNC) and are tweaked constantly. As I find a combination that works
particularly well, I'll upload the latest ones. They work great on my
machines in my environment. Be prepared to tinker a bit as the filament,
local environment, phase of the moon, and name of your first pet can
drastically affect your prints.

Right now I only have the "Normal" profiles in place. I'll upload the
more specific ones as I get them to where I'm happy with them.

Happy Printing!
